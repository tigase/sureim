We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about visitors who are under the age of 13.

1.2 Users Outside of the United States and Canada. 

Your Personal Information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States and/or Canada, where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.

2. Collection of Information

"Personal Information" is personally identifiable information such as your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address and any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information. We collect Personal Information from you on our Site and when you use Tigase Messenger as described below.

2.1 Accounts. 

We will ask you to provide your first and last name and email address, and to choose a user name and password when you register for an account on Tigase. After downloading Tigase Messenger you will also be asked to verify your account via email.

2.2 Suggested Friends Feature.

(a) Tigase Messenger includes a “you may know” feature and a “find more people on Tigase” feature (collectively, the “Suggested Friends Feature”), which uses your address book contacts to help you connect with your friends by making suggestions to you and your friends. The Suggested Friends Feature is optional. When you sign up with Tigase Messenger for the first time you are prompted to indicate whether you want to receive these “you may know” messages. If you elect to receive “you may know” messages, Tigase Messenger will access and upload the emails addresses (but not names) from your mobile device address book to Tigase’s servers, and check if those email addresses are registered to a Tigase user. Tigase will hash the email addresses from your mobile device address book before uploading them to Tigase’s servers. If an email address is registered to a Tigase user, Tigase will (a) inform you of the Tigase user’s first and last name (as registered on Tigase) and Tigase username and (b) inform that Tigase user of your first and last name (as registered on Tigase) and Tigase username, after which you can add them to your Tigase Contacts. Emails are not shared in this process. After this process is complete, Tigase will promptly delete your address book information from its databases. We will retain your email address in hashed format to provide the Suggested Friends Feature. Other users may similarly use the “you may know” feature to connect with you.

(b) You may also use the Suggested Friends Feature at a later time to rescan your address book contacts to check for new friends who have joined Tigase Messenger through the “Find more people on Tigase” button at the bottom of your Contacts. If you use the “Find more people on Tigase” button, Tigase will scan your address book contacts and present you with people that you may know (as described in Section 2.2(a) above), after which you can add them to your Tigase Contacts. Other users may similarly use the “Find more people on Tigase” feature to connect with you.

(c) By indicating that you want to receive “you may know” messages or using the “Find more people on Tigase” button, you hereby opt in to use the Suggested Friends Feature and consent to Tigase’s use of your contact information and address book information, as described above.

Tigase Messenger may be used to send content provided by the Third Party App between users who have the Third Party App installed on their smartphone. For example, if you have a Third Party App installed, you may choose to share the Third Party App’s content with another user. When you elect to do so, the Third Party App will have access to your name and the intended recipient’s name and will send a message to the intended recipient. When the intended recipient receives the message, the recipient will be directed to the Third Party App (if the recipient has the Third Party App installed) or to the Third Party App’s download page (if the recipient does not have the Third Party App installed). If the recipient loads the Third Party App, the recipient will have access to your name, the recipient’s name, and the Third Party App’s content sent by you.
